My name is Xiangtai. I am working as a Research Scientist at Bytedance, Singapore. 

I was a research fellow at MMlab@NTU, supervised by [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/). I have worked as a research scientist/associate at various places before, including JD, Skywork AI, and Shanghai AI Laboratory. I obtained my Ph.D. from Peking University.

My published works are on my [homepage](https://lxtgh.github.io/), and I am open to discussing potential remote collaborations on research. Feel free to contact me via email at xiangtai94@gmail.com.


I love coding and building universal/larger/efficient models (pure vision and multi-modal large language models). 


Moreover, most of my works, including the ones I have profoundly contributed to, are open-sourced on GitHub.
