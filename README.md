I have done several works on these directions during my Phd study at PKU.

(video) semantic segmentation,
(video) instance semgentation,
(video) panoptic segenetation,
panoptic segmentation with depth/part,
transparent object, 
boundary feature learning, 
aerial segmentation, 
video object detection/tracking/segmentationï¼Œ
