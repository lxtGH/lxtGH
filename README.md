I am Xiangtai, and I obtained my PhD degree from Peking University. Currently, I am a research fellow at MMlab@NTU, where I am supervised by [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/).

You can find my published works on [my homepage](https://lxtgh.github.io/), and I am open to discussing potential remote collaborations on research. Feel free to contact me via email at xiangtai94@gmail.com.

Moreover, most of my works, including the ones I have deeply contributed to, are open-sourced on GitHub.
