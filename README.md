I am Xiangtai and I obtained my PhD degree at Peking University.

ðŸ”­ I'm a research fellow at MMlab@NTU advised by Prof.CCLoy.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Segmentation in Computer Vision. Now I carry out the research on Image/Video Segmentaic/Instance/Panoptic Segmentation as well as several related problems.

I have done several works on these directions during my PhD study at PKU.

(video) semantic segmentation, (video) instance segmentation, (video) panoptic segmentation, panoptic segmentation with depth/part, transparent object, boundary feature learning, aerial segmentation, video object detection/tracking/segmentationï¼Œ

Remote Cooperations Discussion on Research are welcome (my e-mail is lxtpku@pku.edu.cn or xiangtai.li@ntu.edu.sg).
